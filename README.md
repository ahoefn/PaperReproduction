# Paper reproduction

In this repo I collect a number of papers I find interesting and reproduce their results.

# Papers

The papers I have in this repo right now, the section title is the name of the folder the files can be found in.

### SubgraphExplain
Based on the paper [On Explainability of Graph Neural Networks via Subgraph Explorations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05152), in it I have reproduced their GNN model and train it on the [MUTAG](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/datasets/) dataset. In the future I will actually reproduce their SubgraphX algorithm and use it to explain the models prediction.


### Future candidate papers
- [Simplicial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03633)
- [Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07576)
